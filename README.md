# LangTrainer
LangTrainer is a flashcard app made with Flask. It is especially suited for learning words in a new language. You just upload the words you want to learn to start practicing. I have not yet deployed the app, but I will when I have made a better version of it using Javascript and not Flask.

## What I have learned
* Flask basics (database, routing)
* HTML basics (forms, tables)
* CSS basics
